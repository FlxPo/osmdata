## 1. Introduction

The `osmdata` package retrieves data from the [`overpass`
server](https://overpass-api.de) which is primarily designed to deliver small
subsets of the full Open Street Map (OSM) data set, determined both by specific
bounding coordinates and specific OSM key-value pairs. The server has internal
routines to limit delivery rates on queries for excessively large data sets,
and may ultimately fail for large queries. This vignette describes one approach
for breaking overly large queries into a set of smaller queries, and for
re-combining the resultant data sets into a single `osmdata` object reflecting
the desired, large query.
